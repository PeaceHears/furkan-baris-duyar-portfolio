                        A passionate game developer with commercial experience at studios like Masomo/Miniclip, contributing to flagship mobile titles played by over 110 million players. My journey began at university, building games in Unity/C#, and has since evolved to mastering C++ with Cocos2d-x and now Unreal Engine 5.

                        I am currently enhancing my expertise by pursuing an MSc in Computer Games Technology at Abertay University, UK, where I'm diving deep into advanced graphics with DirectX11 and AI-driven procedural content generation.

                    <p>Played a role in the development and enhancement of various features within the games produced by my former employer, Masomo. Subsequently, Masomo was acquired by Miniclip, a company owned by Tencent. Notably, I contributed to the development of features in games such as Head Ball 2 and Basketball Arena. These titles are available on mobile platforms, namely Google Play and the App Store. Both games were crafted using the Cocos2d-x framework and implemented in C++. My involvement spanned across diverse stages of the development process for these games.</p>
                    <p>My key contributions:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                        <li>Addressed and resolved various bugs, while also developing and enhancing multiple features within the games. My active contributions have significantly impacted the overall quality and functionality of these projects. In the following sections, I will provide detailed descriptions of these processes categorized under each respective game title.</li>
                        <li>Integrated several third-party components, including Frameplay, ANRWatchCat, Goliath, and IronSource, into both games. Furthermore, I incorporated Offerwall specifically for Basketball Arena. The code I developed facilitated the seamless release of all these components into both games simultaneously.</li>
                        <li>Frameplay focuses on in-game advertisement billboards. In the gameplay screen, I implemented two billboards that display advertisements when available. In instances where advertisements are not accessible, the billboards dynamically showcase the player's nickname or team name. This strategic integration has effectively boosted advertisement earnings for the game.</li>
                        <li>ANRWatchCat is designed for crash and ANR detection on Android devices. To seamlessly integrate this functionality, I had to convert existing C# code into C++. This integration has proven instrumental in reducing crash and ANR rates, as it offers an effective mechanism to detect and handle these issues with greater ease.</li>
                        <li>Goliath is focused on A/B testing, offering the ability to streamline and optimize features by categorizing them effectively. Through its implementation, it has ensured the provision of proper and more efficient features in the games.</li>
                        <li>IronSource specializes in interstitial and rewarded advertisements. Its integration into the games has significantly bolstered advertisement earnings, enhancing the overall revenue generated through these advertising formats.</li>
                    <p>Currently contributing to unannounced PC game in Astrarium Games as part-time.</p>

Despite the complexity, I navigated the adjustments with care and precision, ultimately achieving a successful implementation.</li>
                        <li>Implemented changes to the default characters in a more generalized manner, a task that posed challenges due to the dispersed nature of character configurations across various locations.

                    <p>The game is 2D top-down roguelike fast-paced action style that is played using playing cards. Gameplay is similar to Enter the Gungeon game elements. The player navigates levels from a bird's-eye view. The player plays the game in a casino theme with slot machines and poker tables. The game features randomized enemies, different maps, rooms as well as dynamic card decks that make each playthrough unique. Permadeath is a key element, meaning that once the player dies, they lose all progress and must start over, which raises the stakes and encourages careful planning and quick reflexes. Combat is intense, requiring players to dodge enemy attacks while shooting, slashing and managing a variety of attack styles. With challenging boss fights, and constant randomness, the game offers a high-replayability experience that tests both strategy and skill as the player must use each run to improve and get further through the casino.</p>

                    <p>This program is a sophisticated terrain and object interaction simulation game developed using DirectX11. The game showcases an elaborate terrain system capable of generating procedural landscapes with multiple customization options. The main features of the program are:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                        <li>Procedural Terrain Generation: The terrain is procedurally generated with various methods, including smoothing, faulting, and Perlin noise (Flafla2 2014), allowing for complex and diverse landscapes.</li>
                        <li>Voronoi Regions: The terrain further divides into Voronoi regions colored differently, which provides visual cues for gameplay objectives.</li>
                        <li>Object Interaction: The game features interactive objects scattered throughout the terrain. These objects change colors upon interaction based on predefined rules.</li>
                        <li>Drone Player Control: The player controls a drone, which can fly across the terrain. The drone’s colors change upon interacting with the terrain regions.</li>
                        <li>Game Objectives: The goal is to match object colors with the current region color. Upon matching all the colors, the player advances to the next level.</li>

                    <p>This game is an action-packed top-down experience designed for cooperative play. Developed on the Windows API using C++, it emerged as a project during our time in the Computer Game Design and Programming class at Dokuz Eylul University. Our instructor challenged us to create a game without relying on a game engine, prompting my college friends and me to collaboratively craft a distinctive and innovative gaming experience.</p>
                    <p>The game features four ally robots, and at the beginning of the game, users get to choose the model of the robot they will control. Player 1 and Player 2 are each assigned control of one robot at a time, with the computer taking control of the remaining robot. Players have the flexibility to switch between robots at any point during gameplay.</p>
                    <p>The game incorporates two types of fog. The first type, characterized by a gray color, is employed to define the field of view, allowing players to see enemies. This fog is positioned closer to the player than the second type. The second type of fog, distinguished by its black color, is utilized to establish the overall field of view for the entire game environment.</p>
                    <p>The game features various types of enemies that can spawn from their basements and launch attacks on the players at any given time. I dedicated significant effort to crafting the artificial intelligence logic for these enemies, enhancing their behavior and making their interactions with players more dynamic and challenging.</p>
                    <p>Robots transition to a 'fallen' status when their health points reach zero. In this state, they become immobile and unable to attack. An ally has the ability to assist fallen robots and revive them. However, if a robot remains in the fallen state for an extended period, it will eventually die, and restoration becomes possible only upon reaching the next level or restarting the game. If all ally robots perish within a level, the game concludes, necessitating a restart of the current level.</p>
                    <p>Every robot is equipped with a unique weapon, which is internally mounted, preventing them from switching to alternative weapons. Each weapon comes with a limited ammo supply, and at the start of each level, robots are provided with a set amount of ammunition. Players can replenish their ammo by collecting it from fallen enemies. When a robot exhausts its ammo, the corresponding weapon becomes significantly less effective than its normal state.</p>
                    <p>Movement for both players and enemies is restricted by obstacles, and these obstacles serve as protection against bullets, functioning as effective cover. Certain obstacles can be destroyed using various methods, adding an element of strategy and dynamic gameplay to the overall experience.</p>
                    <p>At the ultimate level, players face a formidable boss enemy. Victory is achieved upon successfully defeating this challenging adversary.</p>

                    <p>This game combines the classic elements of chess with additional rules and introduces unique enemies to create a distinct gaming experience. Players select their soldiers, each representing a specific chess piece with its respective rules, before the game commences. The gameplay unfolds on a traditional chess board, and the challenge lies in employing chess rules to engage with both the chosen soldiers and various waves of enemies. Positioned behind the board is a castle that players must defend throughout the game.</p>
